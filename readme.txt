= How do I find the ID of my Facebook page or group or profile? =

If you have a Facebook **page** with a URL like this: `https://www.facebook.com/misol12` then the Page ID is just `misol12`. If your page URL is look like this: `https://www.facebook.com/pages/pagename/123654123654123` then the Page ID is the numbers - `123654123654123`.

If you have a Facebook **group/profile** then use [this tool](http://lookup-id.com/ "Look Up my ID") to find your Group ID or view our documentaion link above.

= What is Access Token and how to get it? =

Access Token is required by Facebook in order to access their feeds. It's easy to get one.  Just follow the step-by-step instructions [here in the doc](http://extensions.techhelpsource.com/facebook_wall_documentation_wordpress.htm "Getting an Access Token"). 

= Why isn't the feed from my group/page displaying? =

Make sure system requirements are met(look for the tab in settings page), facebook id and access token are right. Also, increase the  **Show number of posts** value from settings becuase 
non-pro version only shows status/textual posts of page/group/profile so there may not be status posts in the number of posts value specified. Finally, make sure if there are no restrictions set in facebook page/group settings comparing with other page/groups for which feed works, mainly remove country and age restrictions in page/group settings.

= Why my facebook profile feed not displaying properly? =

If you created facebook application after 30th April 2014 and using it's token then profile feed may not be displayed for new facebook Graph API(you may require profile id in a different way, contact for that). Actually Displaying feed for profile shows only public and selected posts because of various restrictions.So it's not good to show profile feed.

= Can I show photos and videos in my Facebook feed? =

This free plugin only allows you to display textual updates from your Facebook feed. To display photos,videos,formatted links in your feed you need to upgrade to the Pro version of the plugin.

For this feature please upgrade to the [Pro version of the plugin](http://extensions.techhelpsource.com/wordpress/facebook-wall-pro "Facebook Wall Feed Pro"). From pro version 1.2 getting comments directly from facebook using ajax has been added.

= How do I embed the Facebook Feed directly into a WordPress page template? =

You can embed your Facebook feed directly into a template file by using the WordPress do_shortcode function: `do_shortcode('[mitsol_fbwall_feed_short_code]');`.
